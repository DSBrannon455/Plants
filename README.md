# Plants

<!-- In 2019 I became a Master Gardener, a program providing intensive horticultural training to individuals who then volunteer in their community.  Gardening is a hobby that has given me much joy!  Plants are fascinating!  Propagation was my favorite class.  While this app is simple, using only one model in the Models, Views, and Controllers file structure.  It does have all seven RESTful routes and full CRUD using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and EJS.  It can be a basis for a more expanded app to help gardeners keep track of their data when propagating their plants. -->

<!-- •	When a user goes to the /plants route, they will see an index of plants
•	When a user clicks on the name of the plant, they will be taken to the plants’ show page
•	When a user goes to the /plants/new route, they will see a form to create a new plant
•	When a user clicks create, a new plant is added; then the user is redirected to the index page
•	When a user clicks on the delete button, the plant will be deleted
•	When a user clicks on the edit button, the user will see a form to edit an existing plant
•	When a user clicks “edit plant”, the plant is edited; then the user is redirected to the index page -->
